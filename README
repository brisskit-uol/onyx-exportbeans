*===========================================================================*
* Project that generates xmlbeans used for manipulating an onyx export file

*  IMPORTANT   *
*==============*
To build this project, always (always!) run a clean beforehand...

mvn clean install

or 

mvn clean deploy

The clean cycle will remove the annoying staleFlag from the target directory.
Otherwise, the results will not be what you expected  :-)

* PLEASE NOTE:
*==============*
The accompanying shell scripts (mvn-install.sh and mvn-deploy.sh) - or their bat
equivalents - are the preferred way of generating and building the xmlbeans.
They ensure that the licence agreement is copied into the resulting jar.
